          Are your tired of having to bribe so many politicians and fight so many class action law suits on your own?  Are you tired of having to find lawyers and K-street lap dogs that  don't have any vestige of a conscience?
        </p>
        <p>
          We here at Scumco Cooperative LLC feel your pain and have come together with some of the largest corporations in the world like <a href="#">British Petroleum</a>, <a href="#">Altria</a>, and <a href="#">Goldman Sachs</a> to leverage our funding and lobbying efforts in a targeted way to make sure all our members have full access to all law making bodies, political officials, and Judiciaries needed to stifle competition and protect your business model.

          What makes us different? Why own one politician or regulatory body all of the time when you can own the one you need for that one important vote or service?  Our system works by allowing corporations to trade their owned "assets" on a peer to peer market-place and build up a balance to use other participant's resources. The more your resource gets used, the more you can use others.  Trying to break into a new market and need a EPA waiver?  Simply allow your attack dog newspaper to be used by another user and you can have access to that official.
